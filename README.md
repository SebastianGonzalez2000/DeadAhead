## Zombie survival game

In this game, the player will control a character that will be able to move in 
4 directions in 2D. The point of the game is to **kill the numerous zombies** that 
will be crawling towards the player from all directions using the weapons available. 
**Survive** for as many rounds as you can and beat your personal record!
